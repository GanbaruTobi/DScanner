# DScanner - CTF Drupal Exploit Tool

DScanner 3.0.0 - Made By Taylor Christian Newsome

Overview

DScanner is an exhaustive Drupal vulnerability scanner and exploitation tool built for Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, such as DEFCON. It targets Drupal CMS with a massive payload library covering every known vulnerability up to March 2025, plus generic web and CTF-specific attack vectors. Designed to outshine tools like Drupwn, DScanner is stealthy, fast, and packed with features to help you find flags and win challenges.

Features

Comprehensive vulnerability scanning: Includes all Drupal CVEs, SA-CORE advisories, and module-specific exploits up to March 2025.
Massive payload library: SQLi, XSS, RCE, LFI/RFI, XXE, SSRF, CSRF, file uploads, deserialization, command injection, path traversal, open redirect, session/auth bypass, and CTF flag hunting.
Stealth capabilities: Randomized user agents (including curl/wget), proxy support, and variable delays.
Multi-threaded scanning: Fast execution with up to 15 concurrent workers.
Detailed logging: Forensic analysis in dscanner.log.
SSL/TLS checks: Detects weak protocols.
CLI interface: Supports -u/--url and -h/--help options.
CTF-ready: Hunts for flags in common locations (e.g., flag.txt, .hidden/).
